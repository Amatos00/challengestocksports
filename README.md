# Challenge Stock Sports
This is a small project for a react native interview.

There is no timeline on how long this interview needs to be, some people says the basic version would not take more than 1 hour ( with all the setup already in place )... And the more complete version would take 1 or 2 days , if you do have a full time work position.
